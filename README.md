Just a mini-project to test out pygame.

Spent 3 days coding this lol. 

Really learnt a couple of things, especially how to implement GUI elements like buttons, input box, scrollbars, dropdowns, and more, from scratch.

Made use of sqlite for the database.

To run: download the project, run main.py
